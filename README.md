# AP_FA2: Warehouse

This is my warehouse assignment. All given tests passed and I have made 3 tests for the pickItems() function myself which also succeeded.
The pickItems() function is a bit of a mess and I realize that. But it works, and given the deadline and the fact that it's the weekend, I am more than happy with it.
I don't really understand the purpose of filling out a main.cpp file, when such extensive testing has been done, with all kinds of warehouse objects. So I just copied the mockwarehouse into the main.
